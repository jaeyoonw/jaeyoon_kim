    <h2>in 180 Websites in 180 Days Project :)</h2>
    <p>I was impressed by Jeniffer Dewalt's 180 Website in 180 Days Challenge, so I started this challenge because I thought
    that if I tried a project like this, my skills would also increase. It seemed that it would not be enough time to come
    up with 180 ideas one by one, so basically I decided to implement this Jeniffer's idea by studying and implementing it
    myself without looking at the code. Also, when I suddenly came up with a good idea myself, I decided to add it. And I will publish all the code on my <span><a href="#">Blog</a></span> and on <span><a href="https://github.com/jaeyoonw">Github.</a></span></p>
